Power BI Projects

ðŸŸ¡ Today, I created my first Power BI Dashboard to kickstart my journey as a Data Analyst! ðŸš€

Diving deep into sales insights, I uncovered some fascinating patterns:

âœ… Profit & Revenue Trends
Total selling price: â‚¹401.41K
Profit: â‚¹68.91K (17% profit margin)
Highest profit observed in Q3, with noticeable dips in Q1.

âœ… Top Performers
Product 41 dominates sales, making it the best-selling product.
Category 04 leads in revenue contribution, reflecting strong customer preference.

âœ… Sales Channel Breakdown
Direct Sales contribute â‚¹208.14K, reinforcing its dominant role.
Wholesaler sales are lower at â‚¹59.35K, showing potential for growth.

âœ… User Interaction with the Dashboard
Users actively engage with date filters, indicating interest in seasonal trends.
Hover activity on profit trends suggests curiosity about peak revenue months.

Drill-through features are widely used to analyze product-level details.
This is just the beginning of my Power BI journey! Let me know your commentsâ€”would you be interested in more such interactive posts? ðŸ’¡
