Sales Analytics Dashboard

🟡 Today, I created my first Power BI Dashboard to kickstart my journey as a Data Analyst! 🚀

Diving deep into sales insights, I uncovered some fascinating patterns:

✅ Profit & Revenue Trends
Total selling price: ₹401.41K
Profit: ₹68.91K (17% profit margin)
Highest profit observed in Q3, with noticeable dips in Q1.

✅ Top Performers
Product 41 dominates sales, making it the best-selling product.
Category 04 leads in revenue contribution, reflecting strong customer preference.

✅ Sales Channel Breakdown
Direct Sales contribute ₹208.14K, reinforcing its dominant role.
Wholesaler sales are lower at ₹59.35K, showing potential for growth.

✅ User Interaction with the Dashboard
Users actively engage with date filters, indicating interest in seasonal trends.
Hover activity on profit trends suggests curiosity about peak revenue months.

Drill-through features are widely used to analyze product-level details.
This is just the beginning of my Power BI journey! Let me know your comments—would you be interested in more such interactive posts? 💡
